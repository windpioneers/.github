# Epic

## End User Goal

<!--- A succinct two sentences, at a high (non-technical) level. How will this support WP's mission? Think: facilitating a key commercial milestone, or enabling a significant/strategic featureset to improve user capability.-->

## Overview

<!--- A longer explanation if you wish of the thrust of work in this epic and how that fits into the bigger picture -->

## Qualification

<!--- Epics must be qualified before work begins -->

- [ ] End user goal and overview complete.

### Design

- [ ] **User pain points**. Mention the current user pain points that the epic will solve. Use this to provide context.
- [ ] **Solving the pain points**. Explain how this epic addresses and resolves the pain points.
- [ ] **Mockups**. Where frontend is involved, add mockups and/or prototypes in the epic or a direct link.
- [ ] **Data structure**. For cross-service data items, define JSONSchema and link(s) added here.
- [ ] **Sample data files**. If any data files are involved, these should be added to / linked from the relevant subissues (eg the issues for file readers/writers/storage).
- [ ] **User Journeys**. Where external users (eg W&S team / GIS team / Clients) will use the feature, user journey flow diagrams must be complete and linked to from here or the relevant subissues.
- [ ] **Permission charts**. If relevant (eg permissions resources are affected), create or update the relevant permissions chart and link to it from here.
- [ ] **Workflow definition**. If a background / async workflow is required, add a workflow diagram or text-based definition, placed either directly in a subissue or link it from here.

### Contents

- [ ] For each separate activitiy, there should be a subissue (linked below) made in its relevant repository.
- [ ] All subissues must be assigned to an individual.

### Review
- [ ] Review the above as a team and approve.


<!--- Once the above list is complete, add the `qualified` label to this epic -->
