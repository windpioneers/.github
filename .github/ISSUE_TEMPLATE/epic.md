# Epic

## End User Goal

<!--- A succinct two sentences, at a high (non-technical) level. How will this support WP's mission? Think: facilitating a key commercial milestone, or enabling a significant/strategic featureset to improve user capability.-->

## Overview

<!--- A longer explanation if you wish of the thrust of work in this epic and how that fits into the bigger picture -->

## Contents

<!--- A checkbox list of each item required. Each item should be a simple link to an issue, or a description of a non-issue item like an activity or workshop. Where the item is a linked issue, use the issue reference rather than a long explanation -->
