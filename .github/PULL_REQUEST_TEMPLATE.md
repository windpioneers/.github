PRs into main are released as soon as they are merged. Their descriptions will be used directly to create release notes, so make sure they contain everything (although you can edit release notes afterward).

Anything added between the auto-generation marker comments below will be re-generated on every push, so make sure to add anything you want to keep outside of them.
