# WindPioneers GitHub Settings

Welcome to WindPioneers! This repository defines settings and workflows that are applied universally across all
WindPioneers repositories.

## Conventions

Some general rules that we stick to when using GitHub

### Repository naming
- Repositories are named using `kebab-case` conventions
- Repositories should have meaningful names with a subject/area, as well as an indicator of function/purpose, eg `wake-service` is a webservice (funciton/purpose) to calculate wake interactions (the subject/area).

### Code style rules 
- All repositories should use the `prettier` formatter (to consistently format general html, markdown, rst, json files and more)
- Python repositories should use the [`black` style guide](https://black.readthedocs.io/)
- R repositories should use the [`google R` style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html)
