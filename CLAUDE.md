# Pan-Repository Instructions for Claude

If asked to "review practices" when in a repository workspace, check the codebase to make sure it meets the conditions below.

## All repos
 
### GitHub Actions

- **File extension**. All workflows should use `.yml`, not `.yaml` as an extension.
- **Naming**. All workflows should be named as per the workflow file but in sentence case, eg `sync-labels.yml` should start with `name: Sync labels`.
- **Reusable workflows**


## JS/Typescript repos

## Python based repos
